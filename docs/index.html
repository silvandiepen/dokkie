		<h1>Dokkie</h1>
		<p>
			Dokkie gets your Readme Documentation into a page with one command. Don't
			bother doing anything else, just keep your Readme up to date and
			automatically generate a complete webpage out of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			You know, when you make a package, you create a Readme.md. Well, that
			exact readme.md will be converted into a html page. So you can just deploy
			your package as a little documentation website.
		</p>
		<p>Just keep your README up to date, and Dokkie does the rest.</p>
