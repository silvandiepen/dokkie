# Customize your blog

You blog will have automatically a theme selected by Dokkie. But you can change this really easy.

The easiest way is to choose any of the themes made by [coat](https://coat.guyn.nl). If you like any of these,
you can just do it in your build command;

```
npx dokkie --type=blog --theme=coat-theme-name
```
