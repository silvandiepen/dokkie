# Why?

The why is a big question for everything, in the case of Dokkie, like many others Dokkie came to the existance because of a frustration. "I want to create good looking docs, but I don't want to write them multiple times. I have a pretty good readme, cant we use that for the docs?".

Ofcourse you can, and most of the time its actually sufficient to check the Readme in a github repository. But making it into a website takes another step and usually some code in your repository.

Dokkie fixed that. Just using one command and you can deploy your documentation right out of your package repository.
