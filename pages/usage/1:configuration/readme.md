# Configuration

Configuration can be done multiple ways, the easiest way is doing this through the API, you can set all navigation just in your build script during deployment. But you could also add a `dokkie.config.json` to your repository where you can set all configuration, in that case you can just run `npx dokkie` and it will set it all.
