# Navigation

There are multiple ways you can navigate through a website. Dokkie has multiple build in navigation options.

### Navigation types

By default you will get a footer navigation and a top navigation. But you can also add a sidebar navigation just like you see on this page.

**dokkie.config.json**

```json
{
	"showNavigation": ["header", "footer", "sidebar"]
}
```

### Flat navigation

Dokkie creates the navigation, like you structure your files. But if you want, you can also make the navigation completely flat.

**dokkie.config.json**

```json
{
	"flatNavigation": true
}
```
