# Pages

All `.md` files within the reach of `input` will be found and made into pages. The pages will be made in the same structure as the markdown files found.

You can create a folder called `pages` where you can store markdown documentation files. These files won't get the prefix 'pages/' in the url but will be put into the root of the docs.
